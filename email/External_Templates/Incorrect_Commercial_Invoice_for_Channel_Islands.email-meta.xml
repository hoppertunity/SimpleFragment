    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

I am emailing in relation to consignment number {!Case.Consignment_Number__c} that is going to the Channel Islands.

The consignment has been held at our depot as the goods need a commercial invoice for Customs purposes. Please can you provide this to us by return email.

Yours sincerely,

TNT Domestic Customer Service</textOnly>
